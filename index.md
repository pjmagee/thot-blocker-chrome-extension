## TwitchBlocker

This extension can be used to remove twitch streamers from suggested list & channel directory.

- Toxic game streamers? Add them to the list and you wont see them again!  
- Hot tub streamers taking over Just chatting? Add them to the list and you wont see them again!

It does **not** remove the ability to access the streamers channels.
